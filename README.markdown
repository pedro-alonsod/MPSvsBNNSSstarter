# Metal Performance Shaders Matrix Multiplication

This app compares the speed of the matrix multiplication routines from the Metal Performance Shaders framework with:

- BLAS (Accelerate framework)
- fully-connected layer from MPSCNN

To run the app you need Xcode 8 and an iOS 10-compatible device with at least an A8 processor.
